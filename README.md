# REAL ML
The Recognizing, Exploring, and Articulating Limitations in Machine Learning research tool (REAL ML) is a set of guided activities to help ML researchers recognize, explore, and articulate the limitations that arise in their research. The tool includes an instructional guide (pdf) and a worksheet (editable Word document) that you will find in this repository.

For more information on how this tool was created, you can read the full FAccT paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533122">REAL ML: Recognizing, Exploring, and Articulating Limitations of Machine Learning Research.</a>
