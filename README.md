# REAL-ML
The Recognizing, Exploring, and Articulating Limitations in Machine Learning research tool (REAL ML) is a set of guided activities to help ML researchers recognize, explore, and articulate the limitations that arise in their research. The tool includes an instructional guide (pdf) and a worksheet (editable Word document) that you will find in this repository.
