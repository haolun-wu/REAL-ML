# REAL ML
The Recognizing, Exploring, and Articulating Limitations in Machine Learning research tool (REAL ML) is a set of guided activities to help ML researchers recognize, explore, and articulate the limitations that arise in their research. The tool includes an instructional guide (pdf) and a worksheet (editable Word document) that you will find in this repository. It is recommended that you fill out the REAL ML worksheet while completing the activities outlined in REAL ML.

For more information on how this tool was created, you can read the full FAccT paper, <a href="http://www.jennwv.com/papers/realml.pdf">REAL ML: Recognizing, Exploring, and Articulating Limitations of Machine Learning Research.</a>
